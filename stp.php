        I offer a proficient grasp of wire-frame iterations, making visual analyses,
        implementing creative color/ image treatments, and conducting A/B testing to
        strengthen information architecture from proto-site to live pages.
        Following accessibility practices maintained by ARIA guidelines for an accessible
        site, I am always seeking more ways to cater the web to all regardless of audio,
        visual, motor, or cognitive abilities.

        Accompanied by a keen force in delivering heuristic and comparative analysis data,
        I’ve worked for three years beside small teams of graphic and web designers to go beyond
        the client’s expectations. Diligently working with web developers has nurtured a strength
        in communication between back/ front-end development and UX/ UI design. Teamed with hired
        branding agents in the past to apply complete site re-brands to organic layout design has
        fostered an eye for attention to detail to effectively create site identity.

        Equipped with these acquired tenants of strong work ethics, we can steadily navigate
        the open water of developing the web while searching for the answers to create a broader,
        more accessible, and dynamic internet experience.

        Let’s feel good at the end of the day together!
